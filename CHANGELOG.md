## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-13

### Added
- **`src/searchCore.ts`** — New shared module exporting `extractTerms()` and `keywordScore()`. `mcpServer.ts` and `contextStore.ts` now consume the same scorer, eliminating the duplicated ranking code that caused the v1.1.5 search-intersection drift.
- **`src/contextStore.ts`** — New `getStartupCandidates(count)` method. Replaces pure-recency selection for the auto-injected `session-memory.instructions.md` brief with an importance-aware ranker: `recency (7-day exp decay, 0..10) + userTags (10) + decisions present (4) + problemsSolved present (4) + typed-observation (1)`. Pinned or decision-bearing older sessions can now outrank a recent-but-empty one; pure-recency behaviour is preserved when no metadata exists.
- **`src/contextProvider.ts`** — `buildStartupContext()` now emits `HH:MM` timestamps (e.g. `5/13/2026 14:32`) instead of date-only, and adds a `Files:` line (first 5 + `(+N more)`) so a fresh agent can see *which files* a prior session touched without a round-trip. Exported `formatInjectTimestamp(ts)` helper.
- **`src/extension.ts`** — Shutdown recovery flow. On `deactivate()` any buffered `SessionCapture` events are drained and synchronously written to `pending-events.json` (tmp+rename, mode `0o600`) inside the extension's globalStorage directory; a best-effort async compress is then awaited via the new `async deactivate()`. On the next `activate()`, `restorePendingEvents()` re-injects those events into the capture buffer and deletes the recovery file — preventing data loss on window reload, VS Code crash, or shutdown-timeout truncation.
- **`src/sessionCapture.ts`** — New public `pushExistingEvent(e)` method used by the recovery flow to re-inject already-captured events without re-stamping `ts`/`id`.
- **`esbuild.js`** — New bundler config. `vscode:prepublish` now produces a single ~70 KB `out/extension.js` and a single ~16 KB `out/mcpServer.js` instead of ~25 separate emit files. New scripts: `bundle`, `bundle:prod`, `watch`, `typecheck`.
- **`.eslintrc.json`** — ESLint config (typescript-eslint, permissive baseline). `npm test` now runs `eslint src --ext ts` before compiling, hard-failing on real errors while allowing warnings.
- **`package.json`** — Added `keywords` array (`copilot`, `github copilot`, `memory`, `mcp`, `azure`, …) for marketplace discoverability.
- **Tests** — 4 new tests for `getStartupCandidates` (decisions-beats-plain, pinned-older-beats-recent-empty, oldest-first ordering, empty-store case). Total **98 / 98 passing**.

### Changed
- **`src/contextStore.ts`** — `embedder` is now a private field. Callers must use `store.setEmbedder(fn)`; added `hasEmbedder()` helper. Prevents accidental external mutation of the embedding hook.
- **`src/types.ts`** — Hoisted `import { createHash } from 'crypto'` to module scope (was lazy-required on every call).
- **`package.json`** — `vscode:prepublish` now runs `typecheck && bundle:prod`. `test` script now runs lint first. `package` script bundles before producing the VSIX.

---

## [1.1.6] — 2026-05-13

### Security
- **`package.json`** — Upgraded `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` from `^6.19.0` to `^8.0.0` to resolve 6 high-severity Dependabot alerts for `minimatch` ReDoS (CVE via `@typescript-eslint/*` dependency chain). `npm audit` now reports **0 vulnerabilities**.

---

## [1.1.5] — 2026-05-13

### Security
- **`redactor.ts`** — Fixed `looksSensitive()` false-negative bug caused by stateful `/g` flag `lastIndex` leaking between calls. Added new patterns: `Bearer <token>`, npm access tokens (`npm_…`), Stripe live keys (`sk/pk/rk_live_…`), database connection URL passwords (`postgres://user:PASSWORD@host`), fine-grained GitHub PATs (`github_pat_…`). Fixed `anthropic-key` rule ordering so it matches before the generic `sk-` OpenAI rule.
- **`contextCompressor.ts`** — Full event log is now redacted once more before being sent to the language model, preventing path-embedded tokens or `az` CLI output secrets from reaching the model.
- **`memoryTool.ts`** — `MemoryStoreTool` now redacts all input fields (`summary`, `keyFiles`, `keyTopics`, `decisions`, `problemsSolved`) before persisting to memory.
- **`contextStore.ts`** — `restoreFromBackup()` now applies redaction (previously bypassed unlike `importFromJson`). `importFromJson()` now validates session IDs as UUIDs, silently skipping malformed entries. `~/.ghcp-mem/sessions.json` is written with mode `0600`, its directory with `0700`.
- **`packs.ts`** — `parsePack()` validates pack name characters and all session IDs as UUIDs before accepting a pack file.

### Fixed
- **`contextStore.ts`** — Search intersection bug: a query term with zero index hits now correctly returns an empty candidate set instead of falling back to all sessions.

### Optimized
- **`sessionCapture.ts`** — Event buffer overflow now uses `splice(0, n)` instead of `slice(-3000)` to avoid allocating a redundant array copy on every 5000-event flush.

### Tests
- Fixed integration test fixture to use a valid UUID (required by new ID validation).
- Added new test: `Pipeline — import skips sessions with invalid IDs` (94 tests, 0 failures).

## [1.1.4] — 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- Removed all remaining `Oluseyi-Kofoworola` references from `README.md` and `docs/COMPARISON.md`; all links now point to `github.com/ITcredibl/ghcp-mem`.
- Version badge in `README.md` updated to reflect current release.

---

## [1.1.3] — 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- `package.json` `repository`, `bugs`, and `homepage` URLs updated from `Oluseyi-Kofoworola` to `ITcredibl`.
- Git remote `origin` updated to `https://github.com/ITcredibl/ghcp-mem.git`.

---

## [1.1.2] — 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- Marketplace thumbnail now displays correctly: icon converted from 1024×1024 RGBA PNG to **128×128 RGB PNG** (no alpha channel) as required by the VS Code Marketplace.

---

## [1.1.1] — 2026-05-13

### Changed
- Publisher changed from `OluseyiKofoworola` to `itcredibl`.
- Extension first published to Marketplace under `itcredibl.ghcp-mem`.
- ITcredibl AI cloud logo added as `images/icon.png`.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Health alert threshold** (`ghcpMem.healthAlertThreshold`, default `30`): a warning
  notification is shown at startup when the memory health score drops below the
  configured value, with a direct link to the Health Report.
- **Workspace-scoped MCP queries**: `ghcpMem_search` and `ghcpMem_recent` now accept
  an optional `workspaceId` parameter so Cursor, Cline, Windsurf and Claude Desktop
  can scope results to a specific VS Code workspace.
- **Auto-gitignore**: `writeStartupContext` automatically appends
  `.github/instructions/session-memory.instructions.md` to the workspace `.gitignore`
  so the auto-generated context file is never accidentally committed.
- **Redact-on-import**: `importFromJson` and `importPack` now re-run the full
  21-rule secret scanner on every imported session, protecting against unredacted
  third-party packs.
- **Test coverage — `azureContext.ts`**: 5 new unit tests covering offline fallback,
  subscription parsing, default resource-group resolution, resource listing, and
  result caching.
- **Test coverage — `contextCompressor.ts`**: 7 new unit tests covering empty events,
  LM happy path, JSON parse failure fallback, secret redaction in LM output, Azure
  tag attachment, and rule-classifier override of `unknown` type.
- **Integration test suite** (`src/test/integration.test.ts`): 5 end-to-end pipeline
  tests exercising compress → store → search → dedup → retention → import-redaction.
- Top-level `import * as crypto` / `import * as os` / `import * as path` in
  `extension.ts` — removed all inline `require()` calls.

### Changed
- **`enforceRetention`** now runs once at startup and once per `compressAndStore`
  pass, not on every `addSession` call (performance improvement for high-frequency
  workspaces).
- **`syncToDisk`** writes are serialised through an async queue to prevent
  interleaved tmp-file writes when rapid successive `addSession` / `tag` / `delete`
  operations are fired.
- **`rebuildIndex`** (called on startup and after `restoreFromBackup`) is now
  chunked in 50-session batches via `setImmediate` to avoid blocking the extension
  host UI thread on large stores.
- `StoredSession` / `StoredDatabase` interfaces in `mcpServer.ts` are now type
  aliases of `CompressedSession` / `ContextDatabase` from `types.ts`, eliminating
  the duplicate interface that could drift.
- MCP server version bumped to `0.6.0`.

### Fixed
- `buildAzureDemoSessions` and the `captureAzureContext` command no longer use
  inline `require('crypto')` — they use the module-level `crypto` import.
- `showMcpInfo` command no longer uses inline `require('os')` / `require('path')`.

  Key Vault, OpenAI, Storage, Service Bus, Cosmos DB detection + `az` CLI snapshot.
- Chat participant `@mem` with `/search`, `/timeline`, `/detail`, `/azure`, `/health`
  slash commands.
- Agent-mode LM tools (`ghcpMem_search`, `ghcpMem_store`) registered via
  `vscode.lm.registerTool`.
