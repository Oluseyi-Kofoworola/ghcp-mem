# 🧠 GHCP-MEM

### You ship features. Your AI shouldn't have to relearn your project every morning.

> **You're an engineer. You build. You ship. The last thing you want is to spend
> the first 10 minutes of every Copilot chat re-explaining what your project does,
> what you've already decided, and why.**
>
> GHCP-MEM gives Copilot a local memory that **remembers what you built**, **proves
> what it remembers** (every stored decision cites the captured events that produced it),
> and **routes most "what / why / how" questions to a millisecond-latency local lookup**
> instead of a fresh Copilot completion — so your token budget goes to shipping, not
> catching up.

**Local-first · Copilot chat participant · MCP stdio · Redaction-first**

## The problem you're actually solving

Every new Copilot chat is a fresh amnesia. The cost shows up in three places:

### What it costs you in tokens (external)
- Copilot re-reads files just to figure out *"what is this project?"* — 2,000–10,000 tokens before you've asked a real question.
- You re-explain the same architecture decisions, week after week.
- Even when memory tools "remember" something, you can't audit *why* — so when the AI is subtly wrong, you don't know it.

### What it costs you in flow (internal)
- The first ten minutes of every chat feel like onboarding the same intern, again.
- You start second-guessing AI suggestions because they might be from a memory layer that's hallucinating context you can't verify.
- You stop trusting the tool — and silently revert to copy-paste prompting.

### What it costs the craft (philosophical)
- **AI should remember the work you've already done — and prove what it remembers.** A coding assistant without provenance is a coworker with confident amnesia: the worst kind to work with.

## Meet your guide

We built GHCP-MEM because we hit the same wall: a Copilot that forgot everything, a market full of "memory" tools that wanted ports, sidecars, vector databases, or cloud sync — and not one of them showing receipts for what they claimed to remember.

**GHCP-MEM is what we shipped instead.** It's the memory layer we wanted: **local-first, evidence-grounded, self-routing.** Built specifically for VS Code + Copilot, then extended to every MCP-compatible agent (Cursor, Cline, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, Copilot CLI) through one stdio server.

**Why we have the right to guide you here:**

- **350 tests, zero native dependencies, zero open ports** — `npm install` doesn't compile anything. Source is formatted with Prettier (CI-enforced via `format:check`) so reviewers see real code, not bundle output. Auditable in an afternoon.
- **Nine documented engineering phases**, each with grounded design rationale in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ITcredibl/ghcp-mem/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). No marketing claims that don't have code behind them.
- **An evidence-citation gate in the compressor** — the LM cannot emit a decision without pointing at the captured event that produced it. Hallucinated rationale never reaches storage.
- **An nDCG@K regression gate** runs in CI — if a ranker change regresses retrieval, the build fails.
- **`/compliance` chat command** prints a one-shot audit report (grounding coverage, trust distribution, conflict counts, redaction stats) — built for the security reviewers in your org, not just for engineers.

---

## The plan — 3 steps

| Step | What you do | What GHCP-MEM does |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Install** | One click from the Marketplace, or `code --install-extension ITcredibl.ghcp-mem` | Activates on next VS Code launch. Zero config required. |
| **2. Code normally** | Edit files, run terminals, push commits — your usual day | Captures events locally, redacts secrets, compresses sessions through your own Copilot subscription |
| **3. Open a new chat** | Type `@mem` or just ask your usual question | Copilot starts with the prior session's decisions already cited. For "what / why / how" questions, the answer comes from local lookup — *no Copilot completion is spent* — which is where the headline token-cost reduction comes from. The synthetic benchmark estimates 5–20× savings on this query class; results on your real repo will vary with query mix. |

That's it. No daemon to keep running. No cloud account to register. No vector DB to provision.

## What you avoid

Without a memory layer that proves itself, the cost compounds session by session:

| If you don't act | What it costs you |
|---|---|
| Catch-up tokens stay invisible | You burn 2,000–10,000 tokens per chat re-explaining what's already in your repo |
| Decisions live only in your head | Three weeks later, you can't remember *why* the auth refactor took the shape it did — and Copilot guesses |
| AI "memory" you can't audit | The model surfaces a confident claim once, you act on it, and only later discover it was wrong — trust is broken |
| Conflicting decisions stack up | "We use JWT" / "We switched to sessions" / "We're back on JWT for mobile" — Copilot sees them all, picks one at random |
| Compliance reviews require a research project | When security asks *what does this tool know about our code?*, you can't answer in under a day |

---

## What success looks like

With GHCP-MEM, the failure modes above are designed-out:

- 🟢 **Your Copilot resumes where you left off.** The auto-injected memory file makes every new session start with context already loaded.
- 🟢 **Every decision is cited.** `@mem /entity src/auth.ts` shows you the supersession chain, the evidence, the contributors — in 500 tokens.
- 🟢 **Wrong rank? You see why.** `@mem /why <q> :: <id>` breaks down every signal that contributed to a ranking — when the system is wrong, it tells you exactly why.
- 🟢 **Contradictions surface before they bite.** `/conflicts` flags "we picked X *instead of* Y" decisions that overlap with older choices.
- 🟢 **Token bill goes down.** The startup primer biases Copilot toward MCP queries (~200–500 tokens) over file opens (~2,000–10,000 tokens) for history questions. 5–20× cheaper from message one.
- 🟢 **Security review takes 5 minutes.** `/compliance` prints the audit report. You hand it to the reviewer and move on.

**Tokens go to building. Decisions stay grounded. Trust holds.**

---

## How it surfaces (4 pillars at a glance)

| Pillar | What it delivers | Try it |
|---|---|---|
| **🧠 Memory** | Persistent, structured record of what you changed, decided, fixed, deployed — captured locally from real editor events | `@mem /recent` · `@mem /entity src/<file>` |
| **💰 Tokens** | Auto-routing primer in every Copilot session steers the agent to cheap MCP queries over file opens | `@mem /route <question>` shows the cost estimate |
| **⚡ Performance** | Hybrid retrieval — BM25 + recency + embeddings + match-ratio + decayed confidence + reinforcement, tuned by per-user adaptive weights, gated by nDCG@K regression suite | `@mem /why <q> :: <id>` decomposes the score |
| **🤖 AI agentic coding** | Full MCP parity (13 tools), evidence-grounded decisions, conflict detection, score explainer, Mermaid graph export — for Cursor, Cline, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, Copilot CLI | `npx ghcp-mem-mcp` exposes all tools over stdio |

It surfaces memory through:

- the **`@mem`** chat participant (37 commands including `/savings`, `/entity`, `/snippet`, `/why`, `/graph`, `/compliance`, `/route`, `/lessons`)
- native Copilot **agent tools** (`#ghcpMemSearch`, `#ghcpMemStore`, `#ghcpMemAudit`, `#ghcpMemLessons`)
- a bundled **stdio MCP server** with 14 tools for Cursor, Cline, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, and GitHub Copilot CLI

### Why engineers trust it (deeper guarantees)

| What GHCP-MEM does | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Auto-routes Copilot to cheap context** | Every new session ships a routing primer that biases the agent toward MCP queries (~200–500 tokens) over file opens (~2,000–10,000 tokens) for "why / what / how" questions |
| **Grounds every decision in evidence** | The compressor enforces an evidence-citation gate: any decision the LM emits without pointing at a captured event is dropped before storage. No hallucinated "we picked X because Y" |
| **Scores trust per memory + decays over time** | Each session carries a `confidence ∈ [0, 1]` derived from evidence breadth, redaction noise, and compressor mode; effective confidence decays with disuse (60-day half-life) so stale memories fade in ranking |
| **Detects contradictions on capture** | Heuristic conflict detector flags decisions containing markers like "instead of" / "deprecated" that overlap with older sessions sharing files; surfaces via `/conflicts` for review |
| **Explains every rank** | `/why <query> :: <id>` returns a per-signal score breakdown (keyword, recency, confidence, feedback, learned weights, …) so when ranking is wrong, you can see why |
| **Learns from your feedback** | `/accept` and `/reject` pump signals into a bounded adaptive learner (±25% per weight, 60-day half-life) so the ranker tunes to your actual workflow |
| **Runs with zero native dependencies** | No Bun, Python, SQLite binary, WASM, Chroma, or model downloads |
| **Opens zero network ports** | No GHCP-MEM backend or telemetry. LM compression uses your existing Copilot subscription only |
| **Stores data locally** | Memory stays on your machine under your control |
| **Redacts secrets by default** | 26-rule dual-pass redaction + custom regex rules + custom-entity literal rules + `<private>...</private>` stripping |
| **Enterprise privacy controls** | Strict mode disables terminal capture, raw snippets, team export, and MCP write tools |
| **Supports enterprise policy injection** | Optional remote policy URL appends centrally managed redaction rules on startup |
| **Idle-triggered compression** | Auto-flush sessions when editor is inactive (configurable 0–300s timeout) |
| **Enterprise compliance modes** | User-defined regex redaction rules for FinTech (PCI-DSS), Healthcare (HIPAA), or custom compliance, plus `customSensitiveEntities` for organisation/project codenames |
| **One-shot compliance posture** | `/compliance` chat command (and `ghcpMem_compliance` MCP tool) renders an audit-friendly snapshot: grounding coverage, trust distribution, conflict counts, redaction stats |
| **Understands Azure workflows** | Azure subsystem tagging, live `az` snapshotting, Azure-specific redaction |

## How it works

### Step 1: Install it

> **Live on the VS Code Marketplace** — one-click install, auto-updates included.

<p>
  <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ITcredibl.ghcp-mem">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Install_from_Marketplace-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white" alt="Install from VS Code Marketplace" height="36">
  </a>
  &nbsp;
  <a href="vscode:extension/ITcredibl.ghcp-mem">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Open_in_VS_Code-22c55e?style=for-the-badge&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white" alt="Open in VS Code" height="36">
  </a>
</p>

| Method | Steps |
|---|---|
| **Marketplace (recommended)** | Install from the [Marketplace listing](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ITcredibl.ghcp-mem). |
| **Inside VS Code** | Open Extensions (`⇧⌘X` / `Ctrl+Shift+X`), search **GHCP-MEM**, click **Install**. |
| **Command line** | `code --install-extension ITcredibl.ghcp-mem` |
| **Offline / air-gapped** | Download a [`.vsix` from Releases](https://github.com/ITcredibl/ghcp-mem/releases) and run `code --install-extension ghcp-mem-<version>.vsix` |

#### Verify the installed extension (security-conscious teams)

Every release from **v1.6.1 onward** uploads four artifacts to its [GitHub Release](https://github.com/ITcredibl/ghcp-mem/releases) page:

| Artifact | What it lets you check |
|---|---|
| `ghcp-mem.vsix` | The exact build the Marketplace publishes |
| `ghcp-mem.vsix.sha256` | Tamper-evident integrity for the `.vsix` |
| `sbom.json` (CycloneDX) | Every npm dependency that ends up in the bundle — auditable before install |
| `release-manifest.json` + SLSA L3 provenance attestation | Build provenance: this `.vsix` was built by the public `release.yml` workflow on the matching tag |

> **Backfilled v1.5.0–v1.6.0 releases** include `.vsix` + `.sha256` + `sbom.json` + a manifest, but **not** the SLSA L3 attestation — those tags predate the workflow fix that lets the attestor run successfully. Verify them via the SHA-256 + SBOM only. v1.6.1+ has the full L3 trail.

End-to-end verification script you can paste into a terminal:

```bash
# Discover the installed version and the matching tag.
VERSION=$(code --list-extensions --show-versions | grep -i 'ITcredibl.ghcp-mem' | cut -d@ -f2)
TAG="v${VERSION}"
test -n "$VERSION" || { echo "GHCP-MEM not installed"; exit 1; }

# 1. Pull the public release artifacts.
BASE="https://github.com/ITcredibl/ghcp-mem/releases/download/${TAG}"
curl -sfLO "${BASE}/ghcp-mem.vsix"            || { echo "no .vsix for ${TAG}"; exit 1; }
curl -sfLO "${BASE}/ghcp-mem.vsix.sha256"     || { echo "no checksum for ${TAG}"; exit 1; }
curl -sfLO "${BASE}/sbom.json"                || echo "(no SBOM for ${TAG} — backfilled release)"

# 2. Verify the .vsix matches its published checksum.
shasum -a 256 -c ghcp-mem.vsix.sha256

# 3. Verify your locally-installed bundle byte-for-byte against the .vsix.
EXT_DIR="$HOME/.vscode/extensions/itcredibl.ghcp-mem-${VERSION}"
test -d "$EXT_DIR" || { echo "expected $EXT_DIR — is the extension installed?"; exit 1; }
unzip -p ghcp-mem.vsix 'extension/out/extension.js' \
  | shasum -a 256 \
  | awk '{print $1}' > /tmp/release-extension.sha256
shasum -a 256 "$EXT_DIR/out/extension.js" \
  | awk '{print $1}' > /tmp/installed-extension.sha256
diff /tmp/release-extension.sha256 /tmp/installed-extension.sha256 \
  && echo "✅ installed bundle SHA matches the public release"

# 4. (v1.6.1+ only) Verify the SLSA L3 provenance attestation.
gh attestation verify ghcp-mem.vsix --owner ITcredibl
```

Step 3 catches the only attack that step 2 can't: a tampered Marketplace artifact that wasn't built from the public source. If step 3's `diff` shows a mismatch on a v1.6.1+ install, **don't trust the install** — open an issue with the diff and the installed-extension manifest.

### Step 2: Let it capture your work

GHCP-MEM records the signals that matter in a coding session:

- file edits, creates, deletes, renames, opens, closes
- diagnostics transitions
- git changes
- debug session start and stop
- task runs with exit codes
- terminal commands through VS Code shell integration

Then it debounces, redacts, classifies, and compresses those events into structured memory.

### Step 3: Ask for the right memory at the right time

Use:

- `@mem /recent`
- `@mem /search`
- `@mem /timeline`
- `@mem /detail`
- `#ghcpMemSearch`
- `#ghcpMemStore`

Or connect the bundled MCP server from clients like Cursor, Cline, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, or GitHub Copilot CLI.

## Get started

Stop burning tokens on catch-up. Install GHCP-MEM and capture your first snapshot:

1. Install **GHCP-MEM**
2. Open any workspace
3. Run **`GHCP-MEM: Capture Session Snapshot Now`**
4. Open Copilot Chat and try **`@mem /recent`**
5. Run **`@mem /savings`** after a few sessions to see session-by-session and lifetime token-savings _estimates_

</details>

---

## Who it is built for

GHCP-MEM is the local, auditable session-memory layer for engineers who live in VS Code, use Copilot, work in Azure-heavy enterprise environments, and cannot run cloud memory services, sidecars, local HTTP workers, or native dependencies.

If your machine is locked down, air-gapped, or subject to data residency rules, GHCP-MEM is designed for your constraints — not around them.

---

## Why teams need this

Without persistent session memory, every session charges the same hidden tax:

- tokens burned re-explaining what the project does
- tokens burned re-establishing architecture and patterns
- tokens burned re-learning why a decision was made
- more tokens spent on the same work, slower progress, worse answers

GHCP-MEM eliminates that tax. **The tokens you stop wasting on catch-up are the tokens that get your work done.**

---

## See it in action

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ITcredibl/ghcp-mem/main/images/demo/pipeline-animation.gif" alt="Animated GHCP-MEM pipeline: edits flow through redaction and compression, then return as recalled memory in chat" width="900">
</p>

**What happens:** every edit, diagnostic, git op, and terminal command is debounced, scrubbed of secrets, summarized through your existing Copilot LM, and stored locally. Later, GHCP-MEM recalls the most relevant prior context in milliseconds.

---

## Core features

### Automatic capture

- File edits, creates, deletes, renames, opens, closes
- Diagnostics transitions
- Git state changes
- Debug sessions
- Task execution with exit codes
- Terminal commands (VS Code 1.93+ shell integration)
- Debounced and rate-limited capture

### Observation typing

GHCP-MEM classifies sessions into:

`feature` · `bugfix` · `refactor` · `docs` · `test` · `chore` · `research` · `config` · `security` · `deployment` · `infra` · `unknown`

Azure signals such as `azd`, `az`, `.bicep`, and `.tf` edits influence `deployment` and `infra` inference automatically.

### Secret redaction

**18 generic patterns** including:

- AWS access key and secret
- GitHub PATs
- npm tokens
- OpenAI and Anthropic keys
- Stripe live keys
- Google API keys
- Slack tokens
- JWT and Bearer tokens
- DB URL passwords
- PEM private key blocks
- `password=` assignments
- emails, IPv4 addresses, and credit cards

**8 Azure-specific patterns** including:

- Storage, Service Bus, Cosmos, and SQL connection strings
- SAS tokens
- 88-character storage keys
- service principal secrets
- subscription and tenant GUIDs

Also strips user-tagged `<private>...</private>` blocks before persistence.

### Hybrid retrieval

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ITcredibl/ghcp-mem/main/images/diagrams/retrieval.png" alt="Hybrid retrieval with keyword, recency, embeddings, and rank fusion" width="800">
</p>

Retrieval blends keyword search, recency, embeddings when available, and deduplication so the right memories surface first.

### Progressive disclosure

| Layer | Command | Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Index** | `/search <query>` | short summaries and IDs |
| **Timeline** | `/timeline <window>` | chronological context around a date or session |
| **Detail** | `/detail <id-prefix>` | full session only after filtering |

This keeps memory useful without dumping huge amounts of text into every prompt.

### Visual Timeline

**`GHCP-MEM: Open Visual Timeline`** (Command Palette) opens a full WebviewPanel timeline — color-coded by observation type, searchable by keyword or branch, with expandable session cards.

### Session CodeLens

A `📚 N sessions touched this file` lens appears at the top of every opened source file. Click it to open a quick-pick of sessions that edited the same path, pre-sorted by recency.

### AI-powered chat commands

| Command | What it generates |
|---|---|
| `@mem /standup` | Daily standup note from yesterday's sessions |
| `@mem /commit` | Conventional commit message from staged diff + recent sessions |
| `@mem /ask <question>` | Cited answer pulled from matching sessions via RAG |
| `@mem /recap [7d\|30d\|90d]` | Narrative engineering recap for sprint retros |
| `@mem /related` | Sessions that touched the active file, grouped by recency |
| `@mem /decisions [keyword]` | ADR-style decision log deduped across all sessions |
| `@mem /savings` | Session and lifetime token-savings _estimates_ plus GPT-4o dollar-equivalent |

| `@mem /debt` | Technical debt ledger — TODO/FIXME/HACK signals grouped by age and file |
| `@mem /adr [topic]` | Formal Architecture Decision Record auto-generated from session history |
| `@mem /pr [branch\|PR#]` | PR review context — surface sessions matching the PR's changed files |
| `@mem /precommit` | Pre-commit check — verify staged changes against past architectural decisions |

### Trust + lineage commands (added in 1.6.0)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `@mem /entity <path>[#symbol]` | Aggregate every session that touched a file or LSP symbol — decisions, problems, topics, supersession lineage, recent sessions |
| `@mem /snippet <query>` | Chunk-level retrieval — returns the exact decision/problem text matching the query (not whole sessions) |
| `@mem /conflicts` / `/conflicts dismiss <id>` | List or dismiss pending heuristic conflict warnings (e.g. "use JWT *instead of* cookies" overlapping with an older cookie-session decision) |
| `@mem /lineage <id>` | Cross-session causal chain — predecessors and successors sharing files within ±30 days, edge-labeled (`introduced_issue_fixed_by`, etc.) |
| `@mem /verify <id>` | Re-run SHA-based grounding validation — per-file `verified` / `drifted` / `missing` breakdown |
| `@mem /correct <id> <text>` | Capture a correction note that supersedes the original session (kept in the audit log) |
| `@mem /supersede <newer> <older>` | Mark one session as superseding another; auto-acknowledges matching conflict warnings |
| `@mem /retract <id> [reason]` / `/retract undo <id>` | Exclude a session from retrieval/injection (reversible) |
| `@mem /noise <id>` / `/noise undo <id>` | Mark a session as low-quality noise — same effect as the ingestion quality gate, reversible |
| `@mem /janitor` | Re-score every stored session against the current quality floor and flag/unflag low-quality memories |
| `@mem /accept <id>` / `/reject <id>` | Reinforcement signal — strengthens or weakens a session's retrieval ranking |
| `@mem /why <query> :: <id>` | Score-decomposition explainer — break down every signal contribution (keyword, recency, confidence, feedback, …) |
| `@mem /graph [file:<path>]` | Mermaid flowchart of the decision graph (supersession + correction + causal edges) for paste into PRs/ADRs |
| `@mem /compliance` | One-shot audit report: grounding coverage, trust distribution, conflict counts, redaction stats |

### Lessons & working-set commands (added in 1.8.0)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `@mem /lessons` | List the consolidated **semantic** (facts) and **procedural** (how-to) lessons distilled from recurring decisions across your sessions |
| `@mem /lessons add <text>` | Pin a hand-authored lesson on the hot path (redacted first) — the "remember this" write |
| `@mem /lessons forget <id>` | Delete a lesson by id prefix |
| `@mem /evict <id>` | Drop a session from the injected working set for this VS Code session **without** deleting it from disk |
| `@mem /pin <id>` | Restore a session previously dropped with `/evict` |

## External MCP clients

GHCP-MEM mirrors memory to `~/.ghcp-mem/sessions.json`. MCP-compatible clients can read it through the bundled stdio server.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ghcp-mem": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/extension/out/mcpServer.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Use **`GHCP-MEM: Show External MCP Client Config`** to get the resolved path on your machine.

**Exposed MCP tools (14 total):**

- `ghcpMem_search(query, type?, sinceDays?, tag?, workspaceName?, limit?)` — keyword + RRF search
- `ghcpMem_recent(limit?, workspaceName?)` — most recent sessions
- `ghcpMem_timeline(days?, limit?)` — sessions by time window
- `ghcpMem_get(id)` — full session by ID prefix
- `ghcpMem_store(summary, tags?, observationType?)` — write a new session from an external client
- `ghcpMem_delete(id)` — delete a session by ID prefix
- `ghcpMem_entity(path)` — aggregate every session touching a file/symbol
- `ghcpMem_snippets(query, limit?)` — chunk-level decision/problem retrieval
- `ghcpMem_conflicts()` — pending heuristic conflict warnings
- `ghcpMem_lineage(id)` — cross-session causal chain
- `ghcpMem_explain(query, id)` — score decomposition for a session
- `ghcpMem_graph(file?)` — Mermaid decision graph
- `ghcpMem_route(query, fileSizes?)` — cheapest-path context recommender
- `ghcpMem_lessons(kind?, limit?)` — consolidated semantic + procedural lessons

## CI/CD Integration: Memory Seeding

GHCP-MEM ships a headless CLI seeder for pre-populating memory from CI/CD pipelines. When a developer checks out a feature branch, the pipeline can generate a condensed summary of recent production alerts, infrastructure changes, or staging test results, and pre-seed the local store.

The next time they open VS Code, their AI assistant already has live-environment context without the developer having to ask.

### Usage

```bash
# Seed from a JSON payload
echo '{"sessions": [{"summary": "Prod API at 50% error rate", "observationType": "bugfix", "keyTopics": ["api", "reliability"]}]}' | \
  npx ghcp-mem-ci-seed

# Or via npm
npm install --save-dev @ghcp-mem/cli
echo '...' | npx ghcp-mem-ci-seed --seed-label=prod-alert
```

### Payload format

```jsonc
{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "id": "optional-uuid",
      "summary": "What happened",
      "observationType": "deployment|bugfix|feature|etc",
      "keyTopics": ["tag1", "tag2"],
      "keyFiles": ["path/to/file1.ts"],
      "decisions": ["ADR-style decision"],
      "problemsSolved": ["What we fixed"]
    }
  ],
  "observations": ["Free-form observation text"],
  "seedLabel": "prod-alert"  // tagged for easy filtering later
}
```

All secrets are automatically redacted using the 26-rule set + any custom rules defined in settings.

## Privacy & security

> **All GHCP-MEM data stays on your machine.** GHCP-MEM has no backend, opens no ports, and sends no telemetry to any third party.
>
> Note: LM compression uses `vscode.lm` — your existing GitHub Copilot subscription — meaning compressed session summaries pass through Copilot's LM. No GHCP-MEM service is involved.

- **Storage:** VS Code `globalState` plus atomic mirror to `~/.ghcp-mem/sessions.json`
- **LM traffic:** your existing Copilot subscription only
- **Redaction:** dual-pass redaction at capture and LM output time, plus redact-on-import
- **Workspace artifact:** `.github/instructions/session-memory.instructions.md`, automatically added to `.gitignore`
- **Attack surface:** VS Code extension host only

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| Memory count stays at zero | Trigger `Capture Session Snapshot Now`, or lower autosave thresholds. |
| `@mem` says no Copilot language model is available | Install and sign in to GitHub Copilot. |
| `/azure` says Azure CLI is not signed in | Run `az login`; GHCP-MEM degrades gracefully if Azure CLI is unavailable. |
| `~/.ghcp-mem/sessions.json` does not exist | It is created on first successful persist. |
| MCP client cannot see tools | Point it to `<extension-install-dir>/out/mcpServer.js` or use the built-in config command. |
| Terminal commands are missing | Enable VS Code shell integration. |
| Tests fail with `Cannot find module 'vscode'` | Run `npm install` first, then `npm test`. |
| You want to wipe everything | Run `Clear All Stored Context`, delete `~/.ghcp-mem/`, and see [docs/UNINSTALL.md](https://github.com/ITcredibl/ghcp-mem/blob/main/docs/UNINSTALL.md) for a full clean-removal checklist. |

## Uninstall

To remove GHCP-MEM completely — extension, stored sessions, workspace artifact, and any MCP/cross-editor injections — follow the step-by-step guide:

**[docs/UNINSTALL.md](https://github.com/ITcredibl/ghcp-mem/blob/main/docs/UNINSTALL.md)**

Quick summary:
1. *(Optional)* Export your memory: `GHCP-MEM: Export Memory to JSON...`
2. Clear stored data: `GHCP-MEM: Clear All Stored Context`
3. Uninstall the extension: Extensions sidebar → gear → **Uninstall** (or `code --uninstall-extension ITcredibl.ghcp-mem`)
4. Delete `~/.ghcp-mem/` (the MCP mirror file)
5. Remove `.github/instructions/session-memory.instructions.md` from your workspace
6. Remove any cross-editor files (`CLAUDE.md` block / `.cursor/rules`) if injected
